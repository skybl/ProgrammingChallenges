Collection of Python solutions to problems taken from the book 'Programming Challenges' by Steven S. Skiena and Miguel Revilla. See the book for a description of each problem, however the code itself should be easy enough to understand directly.

Each programme is a self-contained executable and can be run with:
python programme.py
